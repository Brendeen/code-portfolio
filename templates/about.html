            I'm a full-stack developer located in Washington state, with a wide background of frameworks and languages.
            Creativity has always been something that comes naturally to me. I have always loved to create and build things
            even from a young age, and software development is the perfect place to put my creativity and design skills to
            use.

            When I graduated from high school in 2021, I didn't know what to do with my life.
            I decided to take a gap year and work in retail to save my money. Along the way I bought my first car, received
            a promotion, and saved up as much money as I could for school. I heard about Code Fellows Bootcamp through one
            of my friends, and at first I was skeptical. Though I had always been interested in tech, so I decided to give
            it a try.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-center pt-6">
            Immediately I clicked with code. I worked my way up from working with HTML and CSS to make basic static sites
            off of Github, to creating full-stack web applications in a little over a year. Code is the perfect place I can
            show off my creativity and design skills, creating software that is easy to use and functional is one of my many
            passions.

            When I'm not coding, I am probably gaming, listening to music, or skateboarding (when its nice out). Some of my
            favorite games include Resident Evil, Spider-man 2, MGS5, Sifu and Dying light. I'm also a huge fan of anime and
            comics, I have a big collection of Spider-man comics and various manga series like Chainsaw Man, One Punch Man,
            Blood Lad and Soul Eater.
